# SQL-1_Analyze-International-Debt-Statistics

<p>In this notebook, we took a look at debt owed by countries across the globe. We extracted a few summary statistics from the data and unraveled some interesting facts and figures. We also validated our findings to make sure the investigations are correct.</p>


In this notebook, we are going to analyze international debt data collected by The World Bank. The dataset contains information about the amount of debt (in USD) owed by developing countries across several categories. We are going to find the answers to questions like: </p>
<ul>
<li>What is the total amount of debt that is owed by the countries listed in the dataset?</li>
<li>Which country owns the maximum amount of debt and what does that amount look like?</li>
<li>What is the average amount of debt owed by countries across different debt indicators?</li>
The first line of code connects us to the <code>international_debt</code> database where the table <code>international_debt</code> is residing.
